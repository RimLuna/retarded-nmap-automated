# ATTEMPT 1 AT PYTHON AUTOMATION
*why I failed before even starting*

## NMAP
1. Using python-nmap
	* pip3 install python-nmap
	* Using YouTube Guides
	* Output is messy and I'm too lazy to fix it yet.
2. Scanning local subnet IP addresses
	* Fetch IP
	* Run netdiscover on local subnet
	* Attempt to scan for open ports on IP address
